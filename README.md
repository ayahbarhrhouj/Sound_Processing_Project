Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)  are a feature widely used in automatic speech and speaker recognition.
MFCC takes into account human perception for sensitivity at appropriate frequencies by converting the conventional frequency to Mel Scale, and are thus suitable for speech recognition tasks quite well (as they are suitable for understanding humans and the frequency at which humans speak/utter).

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a technique used to dynamically compare time series data when the time indices between comparison data points do not sync up perfectly.
One of the most salient uses of dynamic time warping is in speech recognition â€“ determining whether one phrase matches another, even if it the phrase is spoken faster or slower than its comparison.
